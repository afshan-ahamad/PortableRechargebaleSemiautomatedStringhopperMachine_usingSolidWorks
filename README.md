# PortableRechargebaleSemiautomated_StringhopperMachine
String hoppers are a very famous food item among Sri Lankans. Most of the people use traditional string hopper press at the domestic level But making string hoppers is time consuming when using traditional string hopper makers. Hence, we have come up with an idea of designing a portable, rechargeable and semi-automated string hopper machine. While designing this we made sure to set the safety and quality of the machine at higher levels. This product is designed using Solid Works.
